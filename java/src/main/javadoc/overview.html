<body>tengi is designed as a cross-language, near-realtime, push communication platform. Using several distinct transport layers,
tengi always finds the most efficient way to communicate between the client and server. Available transports range from a plain
<i>TCP</i> transmission over <i>RDP</i> (a reliable UDP implementation), standard <i>UDP</i> or <i>HTTP Long-Polling</i> as
fallback.</body>
